Ideas for httest 2.0
- Microkernel for network, compare, threads and cut
- be able to emulate any TCP(/UDP) protocol for testing
- httest commands can be construct out of this microkernel
- Configuration file defines protocol and its test commands
- Microkernel commands are directly accessible
- Microkernel supports, functions, if, while, variables, context, threads, ....
- Microkernel need support for ssl, asn.1, compress, crypto and many more
- All procotols should log the same way to be able to expect/match the stream

What we need with in the syntax
- Functions which automaticaly get a thread/process wide context
- The process context must be protected with mutexes
- Functions can be called with arguments like that
  SERVER 8080
  WAIT
  REQ localhost SSL:443 client.key.pem client.cert.pem
  ...
  END
- Function can be a body for more functions to call like SERVER, CLIENT, BLOCK, ...
- Enviroment variables: system, process and thread with variables
