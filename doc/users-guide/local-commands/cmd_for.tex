\section{\_FOR}
\label{cmd:_FOR}

\paragraph{Syntax:}
\subparagraph{}
\texttt{\_FOR <variable-name> "|'<string>*"|'}

\paragraph{Purpose:}
\subparagraph{}
Allows to define a body of script code (similar to a \texttt{BLOCK}) which 
is executed once for each of a given number of elements, similar to 
\texttt{for-each} constructs of some programming languages.

\subparagraph{}
The elements are in a string, separated by blank characters (spaces). The 
\texttt{\_FOR}-body must be closed with a corresponding \texttt{\_END} command.

\begin{usplisting}
    _FOR I "First Second Third"
      _DEBUG $I
    _END
\end{usplisting}
