\label{cmd:_RPS}

\paragraph{Syntax:}
\subparagraph{}
\texttt{\_RPS <number of requests> <duration>}

\paragraph{Purpose:}
\subparagraph{}
Defines a code body which limits the maximum number of requests 
that may be sent during a certain period of time (specified in number of seconds). 
The requests are counted during the invocation of the \texttt{\_WAIT} command.

\subparagraph{}
The body must be closed with the \texttt{\_END RPS} command.

\subparagraph{}
The following example limits the number of requests to be sent within 
the next 300 seconds to 20:

\begin{usplisting}
    _RPS 20 300
    _REQ localhost 8080
    __GET / HTTP/1.1
    __Host: localhost
    __
    _WAIT
    _END RPS
\end{usplisting}
