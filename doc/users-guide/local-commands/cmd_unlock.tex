\section{\_UNLOCK}
\label{cmd:_UNLOCK}

\paragraph{Syntax:}
\subparagraph{}
\texttt{\_UNLOCK}, \texttt{\_PROC:UNLOCK}

\paragraph{Purpose:}
\subparagraph{}
Provides synchronization between \texttt{CLIENTs}, \texttt{SERVERs}
and \texttt{DAEMONs} by unlocking the one and only global mutex.
If the mutex is already locked by a \texttt{\_LOCK} call in the same
or in another body (thread), this command releases it, otherwise it
does nothing.
