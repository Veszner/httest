\section{\_LOCK}
\label{cmd:_LOCK}

\paragraph{Syntax:}
\subparagraph{}
\texttt{\_LOCK}, \texttt{\_PROC:LOCK}

\paragraph{Purpose:}
\subparagraph{}
Provides synchronization between \texttt{CLIENTs}, \texttt{SERVERs}
and \texttt{DAEMONs} by locking the one and only global mutex.
If the mutex is already locked, this command waits until it is unlocked by an
\texttt{\_UNLOCK} call in the same body (thread) or in another.
