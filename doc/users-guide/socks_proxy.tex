\section{SOCKS Proxy}

The problem that a server is not reachable in a given network it makes
it neccessary to build up a SOCKS tunnel to this network and run the test
over that tunnel. Htt do have SOCKS support.

\begin{usplisting}
    CLIENT
      _REQ your.socks.host 6667 
      _SOCKS:CONNECT www.wikipedia.com 80
      __GET / HTTP/1.1
      __Host: www.wikipedia.com
      __
      _WAIT
    END
\end{usplisting}

First htt do connect to your SOCKS host and port with \texttt{\_REQ}.
An then htt do tell the SOCKS proxy to connect to wikipedia.
