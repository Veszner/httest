\section{SERVER}
\label{cmd:SERVER}

\paragraph{Syntax:}
\subparagraph{}
\texttt{SERVER [<SSL>:]<addr\char`\_port> [<number of concurrent servers>]}

\paragraph{Purpose:}
\subparagraph{}
Begin of a body which starts one or multiple threads running a test server for responding  
to HTTP requests in predefined ways.

The number of threads started depends on the value of the argument for 
the number of concurrent servers. If none is given, it defaults to 1 and 
only a single thread will be started. Otherwise, the same \texttt{SERVER} body will 
be executed in the specified number of parallel threads.

The \texttt{SERVER} must be closed using the \texttt{END} command.

% Please see chapter TODO-REF for details about how to correctly set up SSL connections.
