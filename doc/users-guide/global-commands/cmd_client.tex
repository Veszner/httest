\section{CLIENT}
\label{cmd:CLIENT}

\paragraph{Syntax:}
\subparagraph{}
\texttt{CLIENT [<number of concurrent clients>]}

\paragraph{Purpose:}
\subparagraph{}
Begin of a body which starts one or multiple threads running a test client for sending 
HTTP requests to a server, and evaluating the response.

The number of threads started depends on the value of the argument for 
the number of concurrent clients. If none is given, it defaults to 1 and 
only a single thread will be started. Otherwise, the same \texttt{CLIENT} body will 
be executed in the specified number of parallel threads.

The \texttt{CLIENT} must be closed using the \texttt{END} command.
