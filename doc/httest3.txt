+Ideas for httest 3.0
++Microkernel
What kind of functions are need in all cases for testing.
 - Expect
 - cut
 - transport
 - thread
 - extent
 - reuse

+++Expect
Do expect something in the received data.

+++Cut
Cut anything from the received data.

+++Transport
A transport thing to bind anything to your test.

+++Thread
Start one or more thread to emulate source and sink in the same script.

+++Extent
To make it flexible and easily extentable a extent mechanisme is needed.

+++Reuse
To avoid to copy&paste test code a reusable mechanisme is requested, like
inheritance.

++Example
topic FooTest

  test someThing
    thread
      tcp:connect localhost:8080
      ssl:connect SSL
      >>GET / HTTP/1.1
      >>@headers()
      >>
      expect headers "foo"
      wait
    end

    thread 
      tcp:listen localhost:8080
      expect headers "GET /"
      tcp:accept
      ssl:accept SSL
      >>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      >>Foo: foo
      >>Content-Length: %auto
      >>
      >>Hello World
      wait
    end

    test someTingDiferent
    end
  end

end

topic BlaTest
  function connect host
    tcp:connect host
    ssl:connect SSL
  end 

  test someThing
    connect localhost:8080
    ..
  end 
end

topic FooBar
  create BlaTest foo

  test someThing
    foo:connect localhost
    ...
  end
end
