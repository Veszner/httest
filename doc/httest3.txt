+Ideas for httest 3.0
The main idea is do mesh up httest and lua

CLIENT
  for i=1,10 do
    _REQ locahost 8080
    __GET /step/$i HTTP/1.1
    __Host: localhost
    __
    _EXPECT headers "200 OK"
    _WAIT
  end
END
 
All variable used in lua are also usable in the old httest script.
This could fundamentaly simplify httest and improve it with many
benefits from lua.

The httest parser should replace blocks of httest to 
interpret([[
  _REQ locahost 8080
  __GET /step/$i,$j HTTP/1.1
  __Host: localhost
  __
  _EXPECT headers "200 OK"
  _WAIT
]], { "i" = i })

Every unresolved variable found in block should be added in a assoziative
table which is also handed over to C

It seems to me that this would be the best way to improve httest, better than
creating a new language.

--> Transform httest script to a lua script while reading.
