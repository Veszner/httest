+Syntax httest 3.0
++ Constrains
- Errors must point to the correct line
- Verbose mode should also print called lines

++ Simplify
- Syntax lower case
- Remove underscores before local commands
- No brakets and stuff keep the syntax clean and simple

++ Performance
- Design parser with a compile step to increase script performance
- Command lookup O(1)

++ Architecture
- Still want modules
- Small core

++ Structure
- Composite
  - line, body of lines 
  - An executable do hold variables and other executables
  - to execute a executable a context is needed
- Variables
  - Strings
  - Function is a executable with its context

++ Sample
# comment here
function foo i
  local j = i
  function count
    incr j 2
    return j
  end

  return count
end

  if $foo =~ foo.*
    echo bla

  # result should be 102
