+Syntax httest 3.0
++ Constrains
- Errors must point to the correct line
- Verbose mode should also print called lines

++ Simplify
- Syntax lower case
- Remove underscores before local commands
- No brakets and stuff, keep the test simple and readable

++ Performance
- Design parser with a precompile step to increase script performance
- Command lookup O(1)

++ Architecture
- Still want modules
- Very small core

+++ Parser Object
- htt_object
  - name
- htt_command -> htt_object
  - interpreter
  - list of htt_command
- htt_thread -> htt_command
  - thread context
  - list of htt->thread

+++ Narrative
- Global context is same as thread context
- Compile step lookup commands and translate into faster format (a tree)
- On compilation all thread, function, ... will be created
- Global starts interpret
- Global starts all clients/servers/deamons/... and wait on it
- client/server/... do start interpret
- client/server/... can also start threads and wait on it
- bodies can contain other bodies

++ Samples
+++ First
function foo a b c : d e
  debug a b c
  return "bla" "bli" 
end

client
  req localhost:8080 SSL
  _GET / HTTP/1.1
  _Host: localhost:8080
  _
  expect . foo.*
  wait

  if $foo =~ foo.*
    debug bla
  else
    debug bli
  end
end

server 8080
...
end
