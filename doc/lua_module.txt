+ Goal
Enhance httest with new complicated functions. Lua could be used for customized
string manipulation.

+ Httest Extensions
The httest should be enhanced that commands can embeded in lines like 
variables. For example @command(params...) will be replaced by the returned
string.

+ Integration
Need a hook for global commands. The lua module should make a lua block, which
then will be called from httest like any other block. Only string return values
are supported, everything else must throw an error.

+ Samples
++ Simple
LUA:BLOCK _doSomething param1 param2 : ret1 ret2
  print("first parameter value is = " ..param1)
  return "value1", param2 
END

And this can be called like any other block as follow
_doSomething "hello" "world" MyRet1 MyRet2
_DEBUG $MyRet1 $MyRet2

++ Embedded
LUA:BLOCK _convertSomething param1 : return1
  return "hallo " .. param1
END

_REQ localhost 8080
__GET /@_convertSomething("foo") HTTP/1.1
__Host: localhost
__
_WAIT

++ Embedded with Multi Return
LUA:BLOCK _headers
  RF = "\r\n"
  return
  "Host: localhost"..RF
  "User-Agent: my simple agent"..RF
  "Content-Type: foo/bar"..RF
END

_REQ locahost 8080
__GET /foo HTTP/1.1
__@headers()
__
_WAIT

The multiple returned strings are catonated together.
