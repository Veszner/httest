+ Goal
Enhance httest with new complicated functions. Lua could be used for customized
string manipulation.

+ Httest Extensions
The httest should be enhanced that commands can embeded in lines like 
variables. For example @command(params...) will be replaced by the returned
string.

+ Integration
A lua script can be added as a module. All lua functions will be accessible 
for httest scripts. The lua integration should be able to execute any httest
command.

The interface of lua functions must be string based, becaus httest can only
handle strings.

On the httest side a function "httest:load" do give the worker handle into
lua. "httest:call" should call a httest function like

httest:call("_SET" "A=B");
or
encoded_string = httest:call("_URLENC", "foo bar");
