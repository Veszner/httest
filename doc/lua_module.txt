+ Goal
Enhance httest with new complicated functions. Lua could be used for customized
string manipulation.

+ Integration
++ Registration
The lua script need an anchor which do a module init. The name of the init
function is module_init. This function is called in the lua_module_init 
function and return a list of registered commands. Every registered command
is an object which then is embodied into a worker. Every command do have
the following three commands: get_module, get_name, interpret.

++ Call
The lua objects interpreter is called. The lua object is embedded into a
worker. Parameters of a call are pushed on the lua stack, and on luas return
all values (strings namely) are stored as return values.

+ Limitations
  - Lua modules are not listen in the help, because the command _LUA:LOAD <file>
    is not performed at this point.
  - Only strings can be returned to httest. Httest is fully string based.

+ Future enhancements
  - Calling httest functions in lua.
