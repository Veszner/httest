+DESIGN

++Compile
- Composite of htt_executable_t
- One htt_executable_t is one command or a body of commands

++Execute
- Every htt_executable can have a function, if there run it
- To execute a body the function of htt_executable has to return a closure
- As long the closure returns 1 the body will be executed
- On execution every running body do have a htt_context_t
- A htt_context_t do exist until end of a body
- Variables hold in context.
- Parameters are hold as key/value pairs in a map
- Return variables are hold in a stack

++Closure
- Call a function which return a closure function
- A closure is a tuple of htt_executable_t and htt_context_t
- The closures htt_context_t is a child of the callers htt_context_t
- All variables needed must be a local variable in the closure htt_context_t!

++req/expect/wait
- This should be a main part of htt3
- req is a empty function which is implemented by specific modules
- with the scheme of the given url the specific modules takes action
- scheme could be http://, https://, file://, var://, ws://, ...
- expect it self to have namespaces given by the specific modules
- namespaces of expect depends on the given resource
- "." namespace of expect do get all data received
- in the case of http:// or https:// there is also a namespace headers and body
- on wait all defined expect are checked against received data
