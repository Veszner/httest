+DESIGN

++Compile
- Composite of htt_executable_t
- One htt_executable_t is one command or a body of commands

++Execute
- Every htt_executable can have a function, if there run it
- To execute a body the function of htt_executable has to return a closure
- As long the closure returns 1 the body will be executed
- On execution every running body do have a htt_context_t
- A htt_context_t do exist until end of a body
- Variables, parameters and return values are hold in context.

++Closure
- Call a function which return a closure function
- A closure is a tuple of htt_executable_t and htt_context_t
- The closures htt_context_t is a child of the callers htt_context_t
- All variables needed must be a local variable in the closure htt_context_t!
