+DESIGN

++Command Array
- Global and local commands are hold in two static arrays.

++Global Object
- A global object do hold state of openeing closing SERVER/CLIENT/DAEMON/...
- Do hold the global variables

++Worker Object
- From the global object a worker object is created for every SERVER/CLIENT/DAEMON/...
- A worker object holds the state of thread like socket, ssl, commands
- A worker object do have an interpreter function. 
- A worker object do have registered a default interpreter function.
- Defined Blocks are represent as a worker object.
- _IF/_LOOP/_FOR/_ERROR/... commands with a body are represent as a worker object.
- A module do register a worker object for each of his implemented block interpreter functions. 
- A worker object do have a config hash table for the modules.
- Modules do hold there specific state information in a own object registered to the config hash table of the worker object. 
- A worker object do have a description text and a short description.

+++Default Interpreter Function
- The default interpreter function do read the command lines and execute them.
- The default interperter do lookups of modules, blocks and static commands.
- If command is not found, the default interpreter throws an error.
- The default interperter can handle a breaked loop (command_BREAK).

++Transport Object
- A transport object do understand read and write.
- A transport object capsulate the transport like TCP, UDP, SSL, ...
- A transport object could be cascaded.
