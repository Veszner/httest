.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fB\-\-flags\fR
Space separated NTLM flags
neg\-unicode:
.IP
Indicates that Unicode strings are
supported for use in security buffer
data.
.IP
neg\-oem:
.IP
Indicates that OEM strings are supported
for use in security buffer data.
.IP
req\-target:
.IP
Requests that the server's authentication
realm be included in the Type 2 message.
.IP
neg\-sign:
.IP
Specifies that authenticated communication
between the client and server should carry
a digital signature (message integrity).
.IP
neg\-seal:
.IP
Specifies that authenticated communication
between the client and server should be
encrypted (message confidentiality).
.IP
neg\-datagram\-style:
.IP
Indicates that datagram authentication is
being used.
.IP
neg\-lm\-key:
.IP
Indicates that the Lan Manager Session Key
should be used for signing and sealing
authenticated communications.
.IP
neg\-netware:
.IP
This flag's usage has not been identified.
.IP
neg\-ntlm\-key:
.IP
Indicates that NTLM authentication is
being used.
.IP
neg\-anonymous:
.IP
Sent by the client in the Type 3 message
to indicate that an anonymous context has
been established. This also affects the
response fields.
.IP
neg\-domain\-supp:
.IP
Sent by the client in the Type 1 message
to indicate that the name of the domain in
which the client workstation has
membership is included in the message.
This is used by the server to determine
whether the client is eligible for local
authentication.
.IP
neg\-workstation\-supp:
.IP
Sent by the client in the Type 1 message
to indicate that the client workstation's
name is included in the message. This is
used by the server to determine whether
the client is eligible for local
authentication.
.IP
neg\-local\-call:
.IP
Sent by the server to indicate that the
server and client are on the same machine.
Implies that the client may use the
established local credentials for
authentication instead of calculating a
response to the challenge.
.IP
neg\-always_sign:
.IP
Indicates that authenticated
communication between the client and
server should be signed with a "dummy"
signature.
.IP
target\-type\-domain:
.IP
Sent by the server in the Type 2 message
to indicate that the target authentication
realm is a domain.
.IP
target\-type\-server:
.IP
Sent by the server in the Type 2 message
to indicate that the target authentication
realm is a server.
.IP
target\-type\-share:
.IP
Sent by the server in the Type 2 message
to indicate that the target
authentication realm is a share.
Presumably, this is for share\-level
authentication. Usage is unclear.
.IP
neg\-ntlm2\-key:
.IP
Indicates that the NTLM2 signing and
sealing scheme should be used for
protecting authenticated communications.
Note that this refers to a particular
session security scheme, and is not
related to the use of NTLMv2
authentication. This flag can, however,
have an effect on the response
calculations
.IP
req\-init\-res:
.IP
This flag's usage has not been identified
.IP
req\-accept\-res:
.IP
This flag's usage has not been identified
.IP
req\-nonnt\-session\-key:
.IP
This flag's usage has not been identified
.IP
neg\-target\-info:
.IP
Sent by the server in the Type 2 message
to indicate that it is including a Target
Information block in the message. The
Target Information block is used in the
calculation of the NTLMv2 response.
.IP
neg\-128:
.IP
Indicates that 128\-bit encryption is
supported.
.IP
neg\-key\-exchange:
.IP
Indicates that the client will provide an
encrypted master key in the
"Session Key" field of the Type 3
message.
.IP
neg\-56:
.IP
Indicates that 56\-bit encryption is
supported.
