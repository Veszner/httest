scripts for making "shrink-wrap" httest binaries
------------------------------------------------

by $(whois jexler.net)

resulting binaries:

- mac/unix: apr, openssl, etc. are linked statically
- win:      DLLs for these libs are included

idea:

- distributable binaries that work "out of the box"
- used e.g. in the httestbuddy java editor/gui for htt

what the build script does on mac/unix:

- lib sources are downloaded
- libs are built from source
- htt is built with these libs linked statically
- some basic tests are run

what the build script does on win:

- built libs and DLLs and header files are downloaded
- htt is configured with dummy lib config files
- a visual c++ solution is generated
- htt is built with visual c++
- some basic tests are run

on mac/unix you need:

- usual developer tools installed*
- if not mac or linux, you may need to modify scripts

on win you need:

- cygwin with usual developer tools installed*
- visual c++ express 2010

* if the build fails, just add what is missing ;)

how to build:

- make.sh (clean|all|sln)*
- default target is all
- clean: cleans target dir
- all:   builds binaries on same platform
- sln:   creates a visual c++ solution (on win and unix)
- see target/build.log for details if something fails
- binaries go to target/httest-<version>-<x>[.tar.gz|.zip]

built binaries:
